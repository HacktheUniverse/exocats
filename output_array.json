The planets have been discovered with the HARPS spectrograph at the La Silla Observatory in Chile.","discoverymethod":"RV","lastupdate":"12/11/10","discoveryyear":"2010","temperature":"154.9"}],"name":"HD 10180","temperature":"5911.0"},"videolink":"http://youtu.be/8fLnxGRXcsI"}},{"system":{"name":"HD 101930","rightascension":"11 43 30","declination":"-58 00 24","distance":"30.49","star":{"mass":"0.74","magV":"8.21","magB":"9.12","magJ":"6.645","magH":"6.26","magK":"6.147","metallicity":"0.17","spectraltype":"K1 V","planet":{"name":"HD 101930 b","list":"Confirmed planets","mass":"0.3","period":"70.46","semimajoraxis":"0.302","eccentricity":"0.11","discoverymethod":"RV","lastupdate":"10/12/29","discoveryyear":"2005","temperature":"385.4"},"name":"HD 101930","temperature":"5079.0"}}},{"system":{"name":"HD 102117","rightascension":"11 44 50","declination":"-58 42 13","distance":"42","star":{"mass":"1.03","radius":"1.27","magV":"7.47","magB":"8.20","metallicity":"0.3","spectraltype":"G6V","planet":{"name":"HD 102117 b","list":"Confirmed planets","mass":"0.172","period":"20.67","semimajoraxis":"0.1532","eccentricity":"0.106","discoverymethod":"RV","lastupdate":"06/11/25","discoveryyear":"2004","temperature":"719.6"},"name":"HD 102117","temperature":"5672.0"}}},{"system":{"name":"HD 102195","rightascension":"11 45 42","declination":"+02 49 17","distance":"28.98","star":{"mass":"0.926","radius":"0.835","magV":"8.05","magB":"8.90","magR":"7.6","magI":"7.2","magJ":"6.629","magH":"6.268","magK":"6.151","metallicity":"0.05","spectraltype":"K0V","planet":{"name":"HD 102195 b","list":"Confirmed planets","mass":"0.45","period":"4.113775","semimajoraxis":"0.049","eccentricity":"0.0","discoverymethod":"RV","lastupdate":"10/12/21","discoveryyear":"2005","temperature":"963.1"},"name":"HD 102195","temperature":"5291.0"}}},{"system":{"name":"HD 102272","rightascension":"11 46 24","declination":"+14 07 26","distance":"360","star":{"mass":"1.9","radius":"10.1","magV":"8.71","magB":"9.71","magJ":"6.895","magH":"6.402","magK":"6.259","metallicity":"0.26","spectraltype":"K0","planet":[{"name":"HD 102272 b","list":"Confirmed planets","mass":"5.9","period":"127.58","semimajoraxis":"0.614","eccentricity":"0.05","discoverymethod":"RV","lastupdate":"08/06/12","discoveryyear":"2008","temperature":"877.6"},{"name":"HD 102272 c","list":"Confirmed planets","mass":"2.6","period":"520","semimajoraxis":"1.57","eccentricity":"0.68","discoverymethod":"RV","lastupdate":"08/06/12","discoveryyear":"2008","temperature":"530.8"}],"name":"HD 102272","temperature":"4908.0"}}},{"system":{"name":"HD 102329","rightascension":"11 46 46","declination":"+03 28 27","distance":"158","star":{"mass":"1.95","radius":"6.3","magV":"8.04","magB":"8.93","magJ":"6.049","magH":"5.526","magK":"5.402","metallicity":"0.3","spectraltype":"K0","planet":{"name":"HD 102329 b","list":"Confirmed planets","mass":"5.9","period":"778.1","semimajoraxis":"2.01","eccentricity":"0.211","description":"The star HD 102329 hosts a Jupiter-like planet.

Because of orbital precession, the inclination of the planet with respect to the sky plane changes and the planet often fails to transit. There are periods of hundreds of days with no transits. The next transit will not occur until 2020. The planet is at the inner edge of the extended habitable zone. Because of the complex orbital dynamics, the planet might undergo strong obliquity fluctuations with implications for seasonal cycles.","discoverymethod":"transit","lastupdate":"14/01/29","discoveryyear":"2014","istransiting":"1"}}}},{"system":{"name":"Kepler-418","rightascension":"19 37 44.04","declination":"+38 21 19.62","star":{"name":["Kepler-418","KOI 1089","KIC 3247268"],"mass":"0.98","radius":"1.09","temperature":"5820","metallicity":"-0.05","planet":{"name":["Kepler-418b","Kepler-418 b"],"list":"Confirmed planets","mass":"1.1","radius":"9.7","period":"86.67856","semimajoraxis":"84.4","eccentricity":"0.20","inclination":"89.952","description":"Kepler-418b is one of two proposed planets in system Kepler-418.","discoverymethod":"transit","istransiting":"1","lastupdate":"14/05/27","discoveryyear":"2014"}}}},{"system":{"name":["Kepler-42","KOI-961"],"rightascension":"19 28 52","declination":"+43 37 09","distance":"38.7","star":{"name":["Kepler-42","KOI-961"],"magB":"17.96","magV":"16.124","magR":"16.06","magI":"13.8","mass":"0.13","radius":"0.17","metallicity":"-0.3","magJ":"12.177","magH":"11.685","magK":"11.465","spectraltype":"M3V","planet":[{"name":["Kepler-42 b","KOI-961 b","KOI-961.01","KIC 8561063 b","KIC 8561063.01"],"list":"Confirmed planets","radius":"0.07108","period":"1.21376","semimajoraxis":"0.0116","transittime":"245503.48329","description":"KOI-961 is an M-dwarf with transit signals of at least three short-period planets.
